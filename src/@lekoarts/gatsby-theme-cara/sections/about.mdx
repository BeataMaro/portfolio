## About me

I have been programming for two years. I am
a team player, so I would like to be a part of
your company and work on commercial
projects. I am a patient and persistent person.
This is why I am incredibly determined
to never give up on finding solutions
to difficult problems.
What motivates me the most to
continue my efforts are the visible effects of my work and the fact that
my future projects can become useful to others.
